# Spectroscopy_2nd_order_cumulant
This repository is for computing the absorption spectrum using the correlation function approach with the 2nd order cumulant expansion. The main file to run is spectrum_2nd_order_cumulant.py The python file takes in the testvee_traj1.dat file to use the excitation energies in the first column in units of eV. The time values it uses for part of the code are extracted from testtimefs.txt, which are in units of femtoseconds.

The details of the theory are explained in our recent publication (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.4c01401) in the Journal of Physical Chemistry B, titled
"Axial H-Bonding Solvent Controls Inhomogeneous Spectral Broadening, While Peripheral H-Bonding Solvent Controls Vibronic Broadening: Cresyl Violet in Methanol"
